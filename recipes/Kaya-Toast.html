    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What's a SIngaporean morning if you are not going to get some <em>hearty</em> Kaya Toast? Imagine biting into the warm crunchy bread and then meeting with a contrastingly cool and smooth butter combined with coconut kaya jam.  <strong>Umph! That really hits the spot</strong></p>
    <p>Kick off your day with this local breakfast staple right at home with this simple to follow recipe.</p>
    <p><em>Don't forget to grab your favourite kopi or teh with your toast!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <l>Bread</l>
            <p> I recommend getting soft white bread with the crust shaven off. </p>
        <l>Kaya Jam</l>
            <p>STore-bought jam would be fine. However, I <strong>highly recommend</strong> you to make your own homemade one through other people's guides for a more fulfilling product!</p>
        <l>Butter</l>
             <p>Use salted butter for kaya toast. The saltiness pairs so well with the creamy sweet kaya jam (coconut jam).</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make Kaya Toast</h2>
    <ol>
        <l>Get two slices of bread.</l>
        <l>Cut the crust off the bread.</l>
        <l>Toast the slices of bread in your toaster and toast until they are golden brown, slightly darker if I may put it that way.</l>
        <l>Spread the kaya generously on both sides of the toast.</l>
        <l>Cut thin slices of cold butter and arrange it on top of the toast, about 4 slices.</l>
        <l>Top with another piece of toast</l>
        <l>Cut them into four equal sizes or you can cut it diagonally into half. The cold butter will gradually melt when it comes into contact with the heat from the toast.</l>
        <l>Enjoy your toast with some kopi/teh and some soft-boiled eggs!</l>
    </ol>
