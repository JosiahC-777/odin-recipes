    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If your chicken is not smooth and has the odd tiny feather left, rub it with salt to smooth out the skin. This is optional, and I usually don’t bother as I’m happy with the quality of the chicken I get. Rinse.</li>

        <li>Poach the chicken.</li>
        <li>Render the chicken fat from step 2. </li>
        <li>Hang the chicken up to dry after rubbing sesame oil all over.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice with the poaching liquid and aromatics.</li>
        <li>Keep the poaching liquid simmering on low heat.</li>
        <li>Make the ginger-garlic chilli sauce (this uses a little poaching liquid).</li>
        <li>Make the ginger-spring onion oil (scallion)</li>
        <li>Make the sambal kicap</li>
        <li>Strain the poaching liquid, then adjust seasoning to create a light, clear soup to go with our meal.</li>
