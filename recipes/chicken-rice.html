    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <l>If your chicken is not smooth and has the odd tiny feather left, rub it with salt to smooth out the skin. This is optional, and I usually don’t bother as I’m happy with the quality of the chicken I get. Rinse.</l>
        <l>Remove the fatty deposits from the chicken (whether whole or portions).</l>
        <l>Poach the chicken.</l>
        <l>Render the chicken fat from step 2. </l>
        <l>Hang the chicken up to dry after rubbing sesame oil all over.</l>
        <l>Cook the rice with the poaching liquid and aromatics.</l>
        <l>Keep the poaching liquid simmering on low heat.</l>
        <l>Make the ginger-garlic chilli sauce (this uses a little poaching liquid).</l>
        <l>Make the ginger-spring onion oil (scallion)</l>
        <l>Make the sambal kicap</l>
        <l>Strain the poaching liquid, then adjust seasoning to create a light, clear soup to go with our meal.</l>
        <l>Chop up the chicken and serve with the rice, the condiments and the soup for everyone.</l>
    </ol>
