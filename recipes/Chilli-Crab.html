    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>WELL WELL WELL.......</em> we have explored what to eat for breakfast and lunch, but do you know what can top it all off? You guessed it, <strong>CHILLI CRAB!!!</strong></p>
    <p>Just imagine it, <em>a big juicy crab drenched in tomato egg chilli sauce</em>, and fluffy steamed <em>mantou</em> to pair alongside it! Now THAT is a full feast for the entire town.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Crab <em>umm...duh</em></li>
            <p> Fresh, live mud crab is the traditional crab used, prized for its sweet and meaty flesh. But any big crabs can be used;</p>
        <li>Chilli Paste</li>    
            <p>Somewhat like a Thai curry, the base of the sauce is made with fresh chillies and aromatics, all blitzed up to release the fresh flavour; and</p>
        <li>Sauce</li>
            <p>Many things go into it but three authentic, key ingredients that thrust the sauce to soaring flavour heights: <strong>the reserved crab tomalley from inside the crab (“crab mustard”), shrimp paste and ketchup.</strong></p>    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dry chilli paste.</li>
        <li>Cut and clean the live crab</li>
        <li>Stir-fry the dried chilli paste</li>
        <li>Stir the crab with the sauce from the previous step</li>
        <li>Add water to the mixture to cook the crab</li>
        <li>Stir in cornstarch slurry and the eggs until the sauce thickens. Once gravy is thick, Chilli Crab is done!</li>
    </ol>
